## [Unreleased]

### Added

- AMD backend (Linux): sysfs/amdgpu — utilization (`gpu_busy_percent`), VRAM
  (`mem_info_vram_*`), edge temperature, power draw + cap, PWM fan %, core/mem
  clocks via hwmon; multi-card (iGPU + dGPU), marketing names from `pci.ids`.
  Zero power caps and gated clocks at idle are handled.
- Initial scaffold: `GpuBackend` trait with nvidia/amd/apple probe stubs and a
  deterministic mock backend (`--mock`).
- btop-style ratatui dashboard: per-GPU utilization/VRAM gauges, history
  sparklines, temperature/power/clock readouts.
- hjkl stack integration: `hjkl-theme` theming, `hjkl-config` XDG config
  loading, `hjkl-keymap` chord keybindings, `hjkl-kitty` keyboard protocol,
  `hjkl-splash` startup screen.
- CI (`ci.yml`) with lint/test/smoke across Linux/macOS/Windows and tag-driven
  release workflow (`release.yml`).
